Simple Calculator in Python: Brief Overview
The simple calculator program in Python allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

How It Works
Function Definitions:

Four functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) perform the respective operations.
User Interaction:

The user is presented with a menu to select an operation (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
The program continuously runs in a loop, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.
Input and Output:

The user inputs two numbers for the operation.
The program displays the result of the calculation.
If the user tries to divide by zero, an error message is shown.
Exiting the Program:

The user can exit by choosing the option to quit.
This calculator serves as a simple project to understand functions, loops, conditional statements, and user input in Python.
